My initial thinking is that I will need to create a smaller map which contains arraylists. From there I will have an array list which has the same first four digits. Then I will find the correct value from the last four digits and return that. I need to figure out how to turn the Buffered Reader into a file of key values. |
| October 31 |  4:00 - 5:15 pm  | I spent this time doing my first attempt at buildTable. To write the code, I thought about making a reasonably sized array and then having chained elements at each index. To do this, I made a node class which stored the key and value for the item, but also the nextNode which represents the chaining idea. I started by converting the key in the CSV file to AASCI using a similar digit to last time. Then I modded this into the range of acceptable numbers, and started traversing through the table. If it matched any of the nodes already in table, then I would do nothing and move on. Otherwise, I added it as an entry to the table at the proper node value. A few things I need to think about in the future are why I even check if it's in the table. At the end of the day, this is really only practical if there are duplicates, which is unclear. Also, I am not sure whether my key --> integer conversion is done properly. I will work on that during class next time. Other wise I feel pretty good about this method. |


To add a new row to the table, click into a cell and then hit shift-enter.
