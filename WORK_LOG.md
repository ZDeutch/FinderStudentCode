My initial thinking is that I will need to create a smaller map which contains arraylists. From there I will have an array list which has the same first four digits. Then I will find the correct value from the last four digits and return that. I need to figure out how to turn the Buffered Reader into a file of key values. |
| October 31 |  4:00 - 5:15 pm  | I spent this time doing my first attempt at buildTable. To write the code, I thought about making a reasonably sized array and then having chained elements at each index. To do this, I made a node class which stored the key and value for the item, but also the nextNode which represents the chaining idea. I started by converting the key in the CSV file to AASCI using a similar digit to last time. Then I modded this into the range of acceptable numbers, and started traversing through the table. If it matched any of the nodes already in table, then I would do nothing and move on. Otherwise, I added it as an entry to the table at the proper node value. A few things I need to think about in the future are why I even check if it's in the table. At the end of the day, this is really only practical if there are duplicates, which is unclear. Also, I am not sure whether my key --> integer conversion is done properly. I will work on that during class next time. Other wise I feel pretty good about this method. |

The way that I approached this was extremely similar to reading the CSV file and forming the array. In this instance, I make the key an integer, and then find the chain in the table. I then will go through the chain and try and find the exact correct match. I am not passing the text cases right now. I think I am modding incorrectly because the error reads that I get a negative index. I remember that we covered negative modding, but I need to |

First of all, I saw that my errors in the test cases were due to integer overflow from modding leading me to get negative indices. I fixed this by simply using the absolute value of the modulus. This may introduce efficiency errors in my code if the method has a long runtime, so I may need to fix that down the road. From there, I realized that I wasn't implementing a rolling polynomial hash in my query, so I just copied the code from above and it worked. I'm not quite sure why I had used parseInt knowing that key wasn't a unique value, so fixing this made my code work. In terms of next steps, I want to properly address the integer overflow and explore a more optimal chaining method to find the perfect balance between number of elements in my map and the length of chain at any given index. |
