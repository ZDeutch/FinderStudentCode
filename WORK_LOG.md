| October 30 | 11:30 - 11:50 am | I started by just reading over the problem set and getting a grasp for what it is asking. My initial thinking is that I will need to create a smaller map which contains arraylists. From there I will have an array list which has the same first four digits. Then I will find the correct value from the last four digits and return that. I need to figure out how to turn the Buffered Reader into a file of key values. |
