My initial thinking is that I will need to create a smaller map which contains arraylists. From there I will have an array list which has the same first four digits. Then I will find the correct value from the last four digits and return that. I need to figure out how to turn the Buffered Reader into a file of key values. |

To write the code, I thought about making a reasonably sized array and then having chained elements at each index. To do this, I made a node class which stored the key and value for the item, but also the nextNode which represents the chaining idea. I started by converting the key in the CSV file to AASCI using a similar digit to last time. Then I modded this into the range of acceptable numbers, and started traversing through the table. If it matched any of the nodes already in table, then I would do nothing and move on. Otherwise, I added it as an entry to the table at the proper node value. A few things I need to think about in the future are why I even check if it's in the table. At the end of the day, this is really only practical if there are duplicates, which is unclear. Also, I am not sure whether my key --> integer conversion is done properly. I will work on that during class next time. Other wise I feel pretty good about this method. |

The way that I approached this was extremely similar to reading the CSV file and forming the array. In this instance, I make the key an integer, and then find the chain in the table. I then will go through the chain and try and find the exact correct match. I am not passing the text cases right now. I think I am modding incorrectly because the error reads that I get a negative index. I remember that we covered negative modding, but I need to |

First of all, I saw that my errors in the test cases were due to integer overflow from modding leading me to get negative indices. I fixed this by simply using the absolute value of the modulus. This may introduce efficiency errors in my code if the method has a long runtime, so I may need to fix that down the road. From there, I realized that I wasn't implementing a rolling polynomial hash in my query, so I just copied the code from above and it worked. I'm not quite sure why I had used parseInt knowing that key wasn't a unique value, so fixing this made my code work. In terms of next steps, I want to properly address the integer overflow and explore a more optimal chaining method to find the perfect balance between number of elements in my map and the length of chain at any given index. |
| November 6 | 12:50 - 1:35 pm  | I spent this time thinking about how I would complete the resize function. What I realized is that I need to rehash every one of my values when I get tot 50% capacity which adds some code complexity. So to make this work I will need an old array, a new array, for both the keys and the values and then I need to rehash the old array content until I put all the elements into the new array and return that. This will be a little annoying to figure out, but that is a problem for the weekend.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               I spent this class time |

I first went through and tried to fix my resize method. I realized that I was incorrectly iterating from 0 - newSize when I should have been going through 0 - OldSize. The rest of the mistakes were fairly intuitive and just required some pseudocode writing with Gemini Guided learning. From there, I went back and corrected my query and buildTable function so that they worked properly. for buildTable I needed to check for resizing and also make sure that I was modding in the correct place, and then in query I was for some reason using the hash value as an index rather than a designated index variable which was dumb. Finally, I made some efficiency improvements by making a friendlier size (odd, prime, and big) as well as making a global count items variable to keep track of all the items in the array so I know when to resize. Lastly, I switched my horner's method from 31 to 256 because in class we talked about representing different types of text. I am not sure whether I was supposed to use Math.abs but it works and I like it even if it adds complexity to my code. |
